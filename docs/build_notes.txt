1.    Quartus Prime Version 22.1std.1 Build 917 02/14/2023 SC Standard Edition.
1.1   VHDL 2008, Settings -> VHDL Input
1.2   SystemVerilog, Settings -> Verilog HDL Input
2.    If windows app is connected then the DE0-Nano flash can't be programmed
      because of a driver conflict with the FTDI component.
3.    If Qsys is changed then the BSP must be regenerated.
4.    If the FPGA is rebuilt then the firmware must be rebuilt to avoid the "Mismatch Warning".

Steps for building from clean repository

1.    From Platform Designer open de0_qsys.qsys (from the PR_ variant directory)
2.    Generate -> Generate HDL, Select VHDL for synthesis output and uncheck .BSF block symbol
3.    Compile design from Processing -> Start Compilation
4a.   Use the copy_sw.sh script from NIOS shell to copy the common files to the PR_xxx directory
4b.   Open Eclipse from Tools -> Nios II Software Build Tools for Eclipse
5.    File -> Import -> Preferences from de0_fpga\utils\eclipse.epf
6.    File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace from de0_fpga\PR_XXX\software
7.    Select both de0_bsp and de0_fw
8.    Right click de0_bsp Nios II -> Generate BSP
9.    Project -> Clean, select Clean projects selected below and Build only selected projects
10.   Select only de0_bsp and then OK
11.   Then again from Project -> Clean select only de0_fw
12.   Right click de0_fw Nios II -> Nios II Command Shell...
13.   Change directory cd ../../script
14.   Program SOF file from Tools -> Programmer, only necessary when flash is empty
15.   Flash the SOF, ELF and ZIP files using ./flash_all.sh
16.   Use the standard out USB serial port (not FTDI part, something like Prolific)
      to monitor serial traffic from the design

      NOTE: In order to build a windows app release version several files/folders need to be
      added to the Install directory. This is necessary in order not to store large
      binary files on github. They are described in the file install_x64.nsi. Also,
      nsis-3.06.1 or higher must be installed in order to build a release setup file.

17.   THE IPP LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED
18.   From win\jack directory launch VS2022 using jack.sln
19.   Select Debug -> x64 project
20.   Rebuild solution using Build -> Rebuild Solution
21.   F5 to run the application
22.   From the win\de0_cmd directory launch VS2022 using de0_cmd.sln
23.   Select Debug -> x64 project
24.   Rebuild solution using Build -> Rebuild Solution
25.   Right click de0_cmd -> Properties
26.   In the Debugging Pane, add -f cmd_file.txt to the Command Arguments field (if Debugging)
27.   F5 to run the application
28.   This application can also be run from the command line


NOTE: ALL SHELL SCRIPTS RUN FROM NIOS SHELL MUST USE LINUX/UNIX LINE ENDINGS (LF ONLY)
